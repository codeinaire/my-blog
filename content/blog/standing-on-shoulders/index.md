I'm grateful for the open source licenses. They let us stand on the shoulders of each other.

I did such a thing today, thanks to a BSD license. This stands for Berkeley Source Distribution. I'm not surprised such a permissive license originates from Berkley, in particular from the University of California its home in Berkeley. The university and city are reputed to be a hotbed for civil rights protests and activism in general of the 60s. It makes sense that such a license would originate from Berkley. The first of such licenses was written for Unix in 1969.

Anyway, enough of the history lesson. Still, it's nice to look back on where the impetus for such a license originated. I'm sure there's more to it, but I'll hazard a guess that the prevailing zeitgeist of the time probably, at the very least, inspired the creation of the BSD.

In anycase, whatever influenced the creation of the BSD, I directly benefitted from it today. Without it an inexperienced dev like me would've spent many hours, probably days, writing a small bit of software that allowed me to send logs to CloudWatch via an API Gateway endpoint.
